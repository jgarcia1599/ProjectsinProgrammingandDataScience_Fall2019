This course is intended for students who are already familiar with programming in Python and SQL and want to apply this knowledge to a topic of their interest. In the first half of the semester this course will follow a cadence whereby each class meeting will begin with a lecture, and will end with students practicing that which they have learned during the lecture.
The second half of the semester will focus entirely on the students’ final project. The goal of students’ final projects will be to build an end-to-end data solution to an identified business problem.
Students are highly encouraged to talk to their classmates and the instructor about the evolution of their own project and get feedback on what techniques, technologies, and datasets would be helpful to move the project forward. That said, we will attempt to address the following topics throughout the semester:
<ul>
<li>Data Science in Business</li>
<li>Web API’s</li>
<li>Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Web Crawling</li>
<li>Descriptive Data Analysis</li>
<li>Text Mining</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Building a Data-Driven Website</li>
</ul>
